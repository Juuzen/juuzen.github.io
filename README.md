# Juuzen Github Pages Blog

*This is the repository for my [Blog Page](https://juuzen.github.io). You probably want to look there for my posts!*

## What is it?

From time to time, I browse a lot of sitepages when I try to learn about web development (right now, HTML/CSS/JS and other related frameworks). So I decided to start this blog to take track of what I'm doing, when I'm doing it, so it can also be useful for other people! If I have something else to say, you can read it on my [blog](https://juuzen.github.io) (or probably here).
